1. Information We Collect
We do not collect personal information such as your name, address, or phone number. The only information we store is the data you enter into the app, and it is stored locally on your device. We do not ask for or store your email address or other credentials for authentication or synchronization purposes.
2. Data You Provide
When using SoulsStep, you can make use of the following features:

* Personal Inventory Mode: Available through a paid subscription, this feature offers an in-depth self-reflection experience for personal growth.
3. Data Synchronization and Storage
All your data is stored locally on your device using UserDefaults. There is no external synchronization with servers or cloud storage.
4. Data Deletion and Control
You have full control over your data:
* Sign Out: If you sign out, all local data (stored on your device) will be deleted. However, your email address will be retained if you log in again.

5. Data Sharing and Third-Party Services
We do not share your personal data (such as your email address or data related to self-reflection and challenges) with third parties. The only third-party service we use is for authentication:
* Authentication: We use standard authentication practices to manage your account but do not rely on third-party services like Firebase.
6. Data Retention
We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to provide you with the app's services and as required for legal and business purposes. If you choose to delete your account, all personal data will be permanently deleted.
7. Security
We take the security of your data seriously and have implemented technical and organizational measures to protect it from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure:
* Authentication: We use standard authentication processes to ensure account security.
* Encryption: While data is stored locally on your device, sensitive information like email addresses is managed securely.
8. Your Rights
As a user, you have the following rights regarding your data:
* Access: You can access the data you’ve entered in the app (such as your progress in self-reflection and challenges) at any time.
